Blog Project
=============


Hi Everyone!
------------

This is going to be your repository for a project that spans
our time learning django.


Getting Started
---------------

 - __fork__ it
 - __clone__ it
 - add the instructors remote:
   `git remote add instructors https://github.com/aiti-ghana-2012/django-blog-project.git`
 - There will be instructions for the first part in the file part_1.pdf in the instructions folder.


=======
django-intro
============

An introduction to django - your first django web app!

Follow the instructions carefully.

This afternoon, we hopefully are going to launch this to the World Wide Web
using heroku!

As always, if there are any questions _please_ ask Jovana or Me.

Good Luck and happy djangoing!


Oh - remember to add the `instructors` remote:

`git remote add instructors https://github.com/aiti-ghana-2012/django-intro.git`
